These files contain the code for a Markov decision process, implemented for the evaluation of different maintenance policies for offshore wind farms. 
You need a folder with monthly transition (Markov) matrices for the wave height and add the path in "app.py". Note that the wave bin-size used to generate the Markov matrices needs to be the same as the bin-size used in the MDP.
